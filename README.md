# ML_tools
These tools help us make a simple machine learning model to train DFT data with just a few clicks using the TensorFlow framework. Thus, our team can build a reproducible, maintainable, and deterministic machine learning model.

## ML_trainNN
Main program trains NN and predict data.

## ML_makedata
Collect DFT data (magnetic moments of each atom, total magnetization, total energy and lattice constant) and save to csv file.

## ML_makeinput
C-programing script automatically runs the VASP calculations.

## ML_predict
Make prediction input for ML_trainNN.

## ML_getdata_OQMD + ML_Combine_OQMD
Download and combine DFT data from http://oqmd.org/ and save to csv file.

## ML_get_data_Restful
Download DFT data from https://materialsproject.org/ and save to csv file.

## Updates:
Pull a request and I will try to make it. Cheer !! :D
